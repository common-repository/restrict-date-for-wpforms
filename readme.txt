**DEMO**: <https://demo.add-ons.org/demo-restrict-date-fields/>

WPForms – Restrict Dates allows you to set specific date restrictions on date fields within your WPForms. It allows you with various settings to restrict the selected dates easily

You can set minimum and maximum dates, specify date ranges, and customize additional options to control the available choices for users.

== Features ==
- **Min days**: Allow admin to set minimum restrict date range
- **Max days**: Allow admin to set maximum restrict date range
- **Weeks**: Allow admin to set weekend/weekdays for the selected date range
- **Exceptions**: Allow admin to add exception dates for the selected date range
- **2 dependent dates**: With min and max date

== Flexibility in Date Restrictions ==
Provides flexibility in defining date restrictions. You can set both the minimum and maximum dates, allowing you to create a specific range of selectable dates. This is beneficial for scenarios where you want to limit the date options based on specific requirements, such as event start and end dates or booking availability.

== Minimum Date ==
Set the earliest date that users can select. For example, you can restrict the selection to dates starting from today or today +1 days or any specific date.

== Maximum Date ==
Set the earliest date that users can select. For example, you can restrict the selection to dates starting from today or today +1 days or any specific date.

== Exclusion Days ==
You can exclude specific days of the week from being selectable. For example, if your business is closed on Sundays, you can exclude that day from the available choices.

== Relative Dates ==
You can utilize relative dates to set dynamic restrictions. For instance, you can specify a minimum date as “+2 weeks” from the current date, ensuring that users can only select dates at least two weeks in the future.

== Improved User Experience ==
By implementing date restrictions in your  WPForms, you enhance the user experience. Users will only see and be able to select valid and relevant dates, reducing confusion and potential errors.
